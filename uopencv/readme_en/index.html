<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>UOpenCV is a wrapper class for OpenCV. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Some of the functions of opencv-python (+ image processing in books and homepages) have been made into classes</span> to make them easier to use (for the author).</li>
<li>This is a class created to create image processing software. Since it is independent of image processing software, you can create various software using classes.</li>
<li>Most functions return an image object (UOpenCV), so you can create a method chain.</li>
<li>As a general rule, methods are called with name arguments.</li>
<li>Most function parameters have been adjusted and can be used with the defaults.</li>
<li>I have confirmed the operation, but the author does not take any responsibility even if any problem occurs in this program. (Author's disclaimer)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Customize</h2>
<ul>
<li>Since it is programmed with python, it can be easily modified.</li>
</ul>

<h2>About support</h2>
<ul>
<li>I do not support. Please use only those who can use it at their own risk. (No warranty)</li>
<li>I don't think I can answer the question by email.</li>
<li>This document is a memory of the author.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update history</h2>
<ul>
<li>ver.1.0 2022/10/01 Completely revised as a wrapper for OpenCV using opencv-python<br>
                   Renamed UOpenCV from UBitmap<br>
                   Version No. was reset</li>
<li>5.4 11/03/20 Last version for C ++ Builder</li>
<li>5.0 07/11/14 Integrated color and grayscale classes</li>
<li>4.0 06/02/15 Separation of messed up color / grayscale processing etc.</Li>
<li>3.0 04/06/16 The TForm2 class of AT-Image ver.2.5 has been completely revised and made independent as a class (UBitmap)<br>
                   Borland's VCL class name starts with "T", so I named it "U" Bitmap<br>
                   Version starts from 3.0 to match AT-Image<br>
                   Class library for C ++ Builder</li>
<li>2.0 99/05/05 Complete review of AT-Image specifications (MDI, etc.)</li>
<li>1.0 98/05/14 AT-Image (image processing software) initial version<br>
                   Software made with C ++ Builder</li>
</ul>
